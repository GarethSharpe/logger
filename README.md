# logger

This project logs data from analog sensors utalizing a Raspberry Pi, Python, Excel, and the Firebase API which collects data and saves the output of the collection for analysis. This project stores the data both on the Raspberry Pi (in a .csv file), and uploads the data from the logger to a Firebase database every 10 seconds. A new log is created every month and all logs are deleated yearly.
